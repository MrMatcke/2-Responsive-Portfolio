            <p>
              Thanks for checking out my site! My name is Mike and just like the header says, I consider myself a "Jack of all Trades." How I ended up here, well it starts with my curiosity and creativity as an individual. I love to learn! 
              My own curiosity and creativity has lead me
              to discovering different skill sets over the years. Originally, I was a videographer, recording everything and making short movies. Eventually, 
              this lead to me getting hired to film and produce videos for weddings, music videos, segments for news stations and other projects during my weekends. 
              <br />
              <br />
              At the time, I was working as a product manager at a big company and I saw a connection with my video projects to project management. Which lead me to learning more about the skillset and 
              eventually moving into Project Mangement Roles at my company. 
              <br />
              <br />
              As a Project Manager, I began my career managing projects around products, specifically eCommerce. This experience got me exposed to working with developers, engineers
              Dev Ops and other more technical fields. 
              Again, this peaked my curiosity and I found myself exploring programming!
              <br />
              <br />
              All the above has resulted in me becoming an experienced and exceptional Technical Professional and an asset to any team I join!
              Please review some of my work and if you are interested, please reach out to me! 
              Thank you for taking the time to read this and for visiting my site.
